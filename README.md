### AdiumMatrix

This is an incomplete starting point of making an Adium plugin wrapping
https://github.com/matrix-org/purple-matrix which I just found lost in a
workspace on my laptop.

It looks like it was a few hours work, scavanged from 
https://github.com/edom71/microblog-purple/tree/adium-merge
(then on http://microblog-purple.googlecode.com), which got as far
as setting up the basic shape of the project but then no code to actually
link or wire in purple-matrix.

**It does not work, and needs someone to finish it.**

It should probably also live in an /adium subdirectory of purple-matrix
but I'm not going to check it in there given it's totally WIP.
